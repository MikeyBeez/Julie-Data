# Julie-Data
Remake of Julie-Julie with underlying sqlite3 database

This is the start of a whole new architecture that is intended to be a kind of command shell with memory.  The idea is to make the computer more useful by saving actions and parameters for future use.  I'm starting off with sqlite 3 as my database, but I may switch to a graph database at some point.  So I will try to make this as database independant (or flexible) as possible.

Initial setup:

Let's start by setting up a new base directory and conda environment:

mkdir -p ~/Code/JulieData/
cd !$
